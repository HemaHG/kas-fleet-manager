#This configuration file contains information about each Kafka instance types, dynamic scaling configuration
#
#The following properties must be defined for each Kafka instance type:
#   - reserved_streaming_units: the number of streaming unit reservations to be made on each data plane cluster
#
#The following properties must be defined for each instance types compute node configuration:
#   - max_compute_nodes: the maximum number of nodes needed to create an appropriate machine pool with the configuration needed by the autoscaler
