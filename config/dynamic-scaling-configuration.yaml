#This configuration file contains information about each Kafka instance types, dynamic scaling configuration
#
#The following properties must be defined for each instance types compute node configuration:
#   - max_compute_nodes: the maximum number of nodes needed to create an appropriate machine pool with the configuration needed by the autoscaler

# For each supported cloud provider, the following properties must be provided for the machine type
#   - cluster_wide_workload_machine_type: the instance type size to handle cluster wide workloads e.g ingress controllers, observability operators, etc 
#   - kafka_workload_machine_type: the instance type size to handle the Kafka instance workload e.g brokers, kafka-admin API, etc

# Whether to auto create a data plane cluster.
# The value is used to control whether kas-fleet-manager (KFM) should trigger the creation of new data plane clusters.
# If it is set to false, then KFM will only perform scale up evaluation without triggering scale up i.e a dry run of cluster's creation.
# If set to true, then KFM will perform scale up evaluation and trigger scaling up if it is needed based on the evaluation results.

# Whether to auto delete a data plane cluster cluster
# The value is used to control whether KFM should trigger the deletion of data plane clusters.
# If it is set to false, then KFM will only perform scale down evaluation without triggering scale down i.e a dry run for clusters' deletion.
# If set to true, then KFM will perform scale down evaluation and trigger scaling down if it is needed based on the evaluation results.
